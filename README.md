# Stopwatch App with Task Tracker

This is a simple macOS stopwatch application that runs in the menu bar. It allows you to track the time for various tasks, with the ability to start, reset, and record task durations. The app also lets you set a task name when starting or resetting the timer. Upon reset, it saves the previous task's duration and prompts for a new task name.

## Features

- Allows starting, resetting, and tracking multiple tasks.
- When resetting the timer, prompts the user for a task name.
- Records the duration of each task and stores it temporarily within the app.
- Supports a global hotkey (`Ctrl + 0`) to reset and start the timer from anywhere.
- Task duration can be recorded and accessed within the app.
